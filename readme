# Flask API for Arabic Letter Recognition

This Flask application serves as an API for recognizing Arabic letters from images using a trained TensorFlow model.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Docker and Flask

### Installation


1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>

2. Build the Docker image:

   docker build -t my-flask-app .

3. Running the Application:
   
   docker run -p 5000:5000 my-flask-app

4. Access the API:
   
   The API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000/predict.
   
   Example for the request body: '{"image":"<base64_encoded_image_data>"}

   Expected Response: 
        {
        "letter": "<predicted_letter>",
        "probability": "<predicted_probability>"
        }

## Files in the Repository
        app.py: Flask application script containing API endpoints and model inference logic.
        requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies for the project.
        model_1.h5: Pre-trained TensorFlow model for letter recognition.
        label_encoder.pkl: Pickle file containing the label encoder used for decoding predictions.

## Notes
        This Flask app is configured to run in a Docker container for portability and ease of deployment.
        Ensure proper encoding of the image data (base64_encoded_image_data) when making POST requests to /predict.
